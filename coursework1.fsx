  Answer the questions below.  You answers to questions 1--7 should be
  correct F# code written after the question. This file is an F#
  script file, it should be possible to load the whole file at
  once. If you can't then you have introduced a syntax error
  somewhere.

// 1. Make an instance of a tuple with 3 elements, where all elements are of different types.

// 2. Make an instance of a tuple of type int * int * int * int .

// 3. Make a function that takes two arguments, an integer and a five element tuple of integers
// that returns true if the sum of any three elements of the tuple is greater than the first argument, else false.

// 4. Make a function that takes a tuple of five integers and returns a tuple of five integers where at the 
// position of the largest element would be the result of division of the largest element with the smallest one greater than one.

// 6. Make 3 functions that return the average of the value of elements in
// tuples containing 2, 3, or 4 elements of float type.

// 7. Write 3 functions 'allcaps2', 'allcaps3' and 'allcaps4' which capitalize
// the names of strings in a tuple of strings of size 2,3, or 4.
