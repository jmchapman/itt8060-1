  Answer the questions below. You answers to the questions should be correct F#
  code written after the question. This file is an F# script file; it should be
  possible to load the whole file at once. If you can't, then you have

// 1. Make a declaration for the sequence of odd numbers.

// 2. Declare a function that, for given i and n, selects the sublist [a_i;a_i+1;...;a_i+n-1]
//    of sequence [a_0; a_1; ...]

// 3. Use the functions in the Seq library to declare a function cartesian sqx sqy that gives
// a sequence containing all pairs (x,y) where x is a member of sqx and y is a member of sqy.

// 4. Make an alternative solution to 3 using sequence expressions.

// 5. Extend the logging workflow explained in the lecture to support downloading web pages.
// Log the http response code for each URL. Make a function that takes a sequence of URLs and 
// downloads them while logging the response codes using the logging workflow.
